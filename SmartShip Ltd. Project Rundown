Project Overview:
SmartShip Ltd. is a courier company that ships packages for customers locally
and internationally. The company wants to modernize its operations with a system that
allows customers to create shipment requests, track packages, and receive invoices. Staff
members should be able to manage vehicles and delivery schedules, ensuring no vehicle is
overbooked or double-assigned. Managers require reports on shipments, revenue, and
delivery performance.

Identified Classes:
User Class - Parent Class
  Sub Classes:
  ->Customer
  ->VDriver - (vehicle driver)
  ->Clerk
  ->Manager

Other Classes:
-Vehicle
-Package
-Delivery
-DriverLicense

Composition Relationship Classes:
-Address
-Date

Modules:

Shipment Module:
* Specify Sender Information (Possibility of 2 new Classes -> Sender & Recipient)
* Package Weight 
* Dimensions
* Type (Standard, express, fragile)
* Destination (Address + Zone 1, 2, 3, 4) - We canuse the address class to make the destination object
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~ The sysytem should calculate the shipping cost based on:
* Weight of the package
* Distance to be travelled
* Type of package (Standard, express, fragile)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~ Shipment has 5 Statuses:
* Pending - waiting on confirmation from the clerk
* Assigned - describes the (Driver, Destination, Package information (weight, cost, type), Vehicle Description)
* In-transit - 
* Delivered - 
* Cancelled - display the sender and recipient info, time and date of cancellation, original destination
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Tracking numbers should be automatically generated
* Customers can track packages via Online account
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~ Distance is determined by zones (1, 2, 3, 4). Disntace can be a randomly generated based on zone
* Zone 1 - nearest (x to y km)
* Zone 2 - medium range (x to y km)
* Zone 3 - long range (x to y km)
* Zone 4 - very ling range (x to y km)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vehicle & Scheduling Module:
* Undefined Number of vehicles
* Each vehicle has a capacity - (can determine the capacity based on vehicle type)
* A vehicle should not be assigned more packages than it can hold - ( we can determine the amount of packages each vehicle may accomodate)
* Drivers must login to see their routes
* Drivers must Login to see the packges for the day to be delivered.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Billing & Payments:
• Invoices generated for every shipment. (once validated and confiremed)
• Customers can pay via cash or card. (only 2 payment methods)
• Status: Paid / Partially Paid / Unpaid. (we need to define rules for partially paid)
• Discounts or surcharges (e.g., express delivery, fragile handling).
• Receipts are displayed or PDF exported. (let's do both)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entity & Design Requirements (due Week 2)
• ER Diagram with relationships:
o Customer ↔ Shipment
o Shipment ↔ Vehicle (many-to-many resolved by Assignment)
• Class Diagram mapping business objects (e.g., User, Customer, Shipment, Vehicle,
Invoice, Payment).
• Ensure 3NF normalization.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Software Architecture
• Java Client/Server application with database hosted on server.
• GUI:
  o Customer portal: create shipments, track packages, view/pay invoices.
  o Clerk portal: assign shipments to vehicles, update status, manage payments.
  o Driver portal: view assigned shipments, update delivery status.
  o Manager portal: reporting, fleet management, user management.
• Concurrency: handle multiple shipment requests simultaneously without
overbooking vehicles.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Server handles concurrent shipment bookings and assignments safely.

2. Formatted PDF Reports (5%)
Professionally formatted reports with tables, totals, and charts (if possible).
